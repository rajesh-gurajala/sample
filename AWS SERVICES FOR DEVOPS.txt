AWS is a cloud provider,

mainly works on service model, has about 200 services.

it comes under IAS [infra as service ] , PAS [platform as service]


SO AWS DEVOPS TOP SERVICES ARE:

EC2 (server)

VPC [Virtual Private Cloud] // securing aws resources

EBS Volumes	// attach volume to EC2, when many files are created by ec2

S3 buckets		// eg: ur app reads a lot of data from external sources, files, or ur app writes much data

IAM  // users with limited access with policies

CloudWatch	// Monitoring and reliability, like when ec2 usage reaches threshold notify me!!

with CW + lambda ,  second part of monitoring like u send alert emails to other sdes, encrypt ebs if they dont 

Lamda [Serverless] vs Ec2	// eg: when a dev' creates unencrypted EBS volume, u run a lamda function which encrypts it and stopps then automatically, also lets say 100 devs make 100 EBS but waste of time u can just use lambda fxns, as while creating ec2 it asks for ubuntu os, specs etc but lambda fxns instantly create and full fill ur short term needs.
so typically for short-term purposes

Cloud Build Services like AWS code pipeline, AWS codeBuild for CI, build purposes, AWS CodeDeploy  for CD to deploy legacy features or latest features to ec2 servers for users.
Similar to  Jenkins , github actions but restricted to AWS only.

AWS Configuration Services here look configs' u made like make remedy actions here 

Billing services so u can know how much ur org' spending on ec2 s3 services etc .....


AWS KMS	key management services primarlily for privacy and security like enable encryption on S3, EBS , and like u have certificates to store securely.



CloudTrail to enable operational and risk auditing  like it records API activities



AWS elastic k8s services juz a manged k8s by aws.

ECS is aws propeitary container service but EKS is managed k8s service.

ELK (Elastic Search ) lets say to see a common error ur app throwing for last 100 days, to manage micro services.
